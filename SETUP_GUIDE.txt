DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS (THE "STUDIO" SWITCH)

1. Push all files to https://github.com/MLT-solutions/app-legal-docs.
   (Create this new repo on GitHub first if it doesn't exist).

2. Enable Website Mode (GitHub Pages):
   * Go to Repo Settings > Pages.
   * Source: Deploy from a branch.
   * Branch: main (folder: /root).
   * Click Save.

3. Your Official Links are now ready:
   * BiblioFuse Privacy: https://MLT-solutions.github.io/app-legal-docs/bibliofuse/PRIVACY
   * BiblioFuse Terms:   https://MLT-solutions.github.io/app-legal-docs/bibliofuse/TERMS
   * BiblioFuse Support: https://MLT-solutions.github.io/app-legal-docs/bibliofuse/SUPPORT
   * BiblioFuse Guide: https://MLT-solutions.github.io/app-legal-docs/bibliofuse/GUIDE

Note: GitHub Pages automatically renders markdown files as HTML. The links above will work cleanly.
